# Epidemiology-PA-LTA
Research with MRC Epidemiology, looking at latent trajectories of physical activity (PA) data (BCS70).

PA Data prep, harmonisation, LTA on HPC
- Cleaning and harmonising the BCS70 PA data across years

LTA exploration and HPC code
 - modelling latent trajectories on PA data (including code used on the high computing services)

Initial statistics on LTA (ng=4) data
 - checking basic statistics from the LT, including means, SDs, significance checks and some log exposures

Regression with multiple imputation
 - running regression models on the LT data, with multiple imputation
 - convergence checks on multiple imputation
 - DAGs, with SEP as exposure to PA trajectory
